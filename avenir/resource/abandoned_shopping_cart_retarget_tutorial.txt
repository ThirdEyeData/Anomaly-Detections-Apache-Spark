This tutorial is for optimizing retargeting campaigns for abandoned shopping carts.
Solution is based on decision tree. 

Path etc shown here corresposnds to my environment. Please Change them  as needed 
for your environment

Dependency
==========
Please refer to dependency.txt

Input
=====
Generate input tarining data

./retarget.py 5000 > retarget.txt
where 5000 is the number of campaigns

Copy input file to HDFS input path
hadoop fs -put retarget.txt /Users/pranab/retarget/input

Metadata
========
Copy JSOn meta data file to HDFS meta data path
hadoop fs -put emailCampaign.json /Users/pranab/retarget/meta


Map reduce
==========
JAR_NAME=/Users/pranab/Projects/avenir/target/avenir-1.0.jar
CLASS_NAME=org.avenir.explore.ClassPartitionGenerator

echo "running mr"
IN_PATH=/Users/pranab/retarget/input
OUT_PATH=/Users/pranab/retarget/output
echo "input $IN_PATH output $OUT_PATH"
hadoop fs -rmr $OUT_PATH
echo "removed output dir"

hadoop jar $JAR_NAME $CLASS_NAME -Dconf.path=/Users/pranab/Projects/bin/avenir/retarget.properties $IN_PATH $OUT_PATH

For the first run comment out split.attributes=1 from retarget.properties. Get the root level value 
from the reducer output and set the value for parent.info in retarget.properties. Uncomment split.attributes
and make the second run

Configuration
=============
They are in retarget.properties. Make changes as per your need
