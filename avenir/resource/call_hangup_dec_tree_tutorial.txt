This tutorial is for predicting call hangup using customer service call data.
Solution is based on decision tree and random forest.

Path etc shown here corresposnds to my environment. Please Change them  as needed 
for your environment

Dependency
==========
Please refer to dependency.txt

Input
=====
Generate input tarining data
./detr.sh genData  <num_calls> call_hangup.txt
num_calls = number of calls e.g., 5000

Copy input file to HDFS input path
./detr.sh loadInput call_hangup.txt

Metadata
========
Copy JSOn meta data file to HDFS meta data path
./detr.sh loadMeta call_hangup.json

Map reduce
==========
./detr.sh decTree

Move and copy files around
==========================
./detr.sh mvDecFiles

Next iteration
==============
Go back to map reduce step. After the first iteration please uncomment the parameter
dtb.decision.file.path.in in the configuration file and keep it uncommented for subsequent
iterations.


Configuration
=============
They are in detr.properties. Make changes as per your need
