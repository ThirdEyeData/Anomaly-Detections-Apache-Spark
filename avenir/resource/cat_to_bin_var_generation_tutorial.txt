This tutorial for generating dummy binary variables from categorical variables, which 
may be a required step  step before applying using certain machine learning algorithms


Dependent script
================
Checkout the project avenir. Take the script util.py and sampler.py from the project and placeit
in ../lib directory with respect the directory containing store_order.py

Build and Deployment
====================
Please refer to spark_dependency.txt

Generate input data
===================
./dvg.sh genInput <num_leads> <output_file>

where
num_leads = number of sales leads. should be few thousands so that each categorical variable
value appears in the data set at least once
output_file = output file name

Copy the output file to spark input directory as specified in dvg.sh

Run unique value finder Spark job
=================================
./dvg.sh uniqueValues

Run binary variable generator Spark job
=======================================
./dvg.sh binValGen

Script
======
The script dvg.sh should be changed as necessary depending on your environment

Configuration
=============
Configuration parameters are dvg.conf. Make changes as necessary
