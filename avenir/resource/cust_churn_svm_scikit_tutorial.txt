This tutorial is for predicting customer churn with SVM using scikit-learn. 

Dependent script
================
Checkout the project visitante. Take the script util.py and sampler.py  from that project and 
place them in ../lib directory with respect the directory containing store_order.py

Other dependency
================
The script uses numpy and scikit-leran. Itâ€™s best to install anaconda to get all related packages.

I used properties file for configuration and python module called jprops for processing properties 
file. Here is how you install it

pip install jprops

All python scripts
==================
You may to change the first line of all python script depending upon your pyton installation
directory

Creating training data
======================
To create test data use the python script telecom_churn.py as below. 
./telecom_churn.py <num_cust> <churn_rate> <error_rate> > <output_file>

where
num_cust = number of customers e.g., 5000
churn_rate = churn percentage e.g., 20
error_rate = error percentage e.g. 10
output_file = output file name e.g., churn_train_5000.txt

Configuration
=============
Edit config properties file svm.properties according to your needs

Run for training
================
Make sure the parameters in common and train group are set appropriately and then
run
./svm.py svm.properties


Run for prediction
==================
Make sure the parameters in common and predict group are set appropriately and then
run. 
./svm.py svm.properties

You must have saved the model ensemble while training for prediction to work
