This tutorial is for estimating earning statistic for inventory planning using Makov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation 

Dependent script
================
Make sure util.py and sampler.py  from this  project  are in ../lib directory with respect 
the directory containing inv_sim.py

Configuration
=============
The file inv_sim.properties file has all the configuration parameters. Change them as needed.

Determining sample size
=======================
Make sure the configuration parameters related to starting sample size, sample size step and
number of sample sizes are set properly. Then run the following

./inv_sim.py inv_sim.properties samp_size

Determining burn in size
========================
If you want to test for proper burn in size, make sure configuration parameters related to
starting burn in sample size, burn in sample size step and the number of burn in sample size 
are set properly. Then run

./inv_sim.py inv_sim.properties burinin_size

Earning Statistic
=================
Make sure sample size, proposal distribution standard deviation, stating inventory level
inventory level step size and the number of inventory level are set properly in configuration.
The inventory statistic  parameter should be set. The choice either average or percentile. 
If percentile the percentile value should be set. In this tutorial we are using percentile
Run the following

./inv_sim.py inv_sim.properties earn_stat

Proposal distribution mixture
=============================
To use this feature, you have to global proposal related parameters. You also have to  
modify the python code to to properly configure metropolis sampler python object to enable
proposal mixtures.

Sub sampling
============
To enable this feature, you have to define the subsampling interval parameter. You also have to
modify python code to call the subSample() method on the metropolis sampler object instead of
the sample() method
