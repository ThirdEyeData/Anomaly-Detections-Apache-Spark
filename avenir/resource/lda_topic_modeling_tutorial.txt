This tutorial is for predicting CRM lead conversion with Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) and 
ScikitLearn. 

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib and ../text directories with all the python files wrt where topic.py
is. The driver code is in topic.py. Configuration is contained in lda.properties. Since your python
installation is likely to be different, please run all python scripts starting with 
python abc.py ...

Training
========
Run
./topic.py lda.properties

The parameter mode should be set as common.mode=train. If the model needs to saved all the directory
and filename related parameters need to set. The save flag should be set as follows train.model.save=True
The training input data directory should be specified as train.data.dir=data/topics/train

if the purpose is to explore differ number of topics, the topic number parameter should se set to a range
as train.num.topics=3,8. Once the number of topics has been decided, the parameter should be set to single
value as train.num.topics=5


Analyze
=======
Run
./topic.py lda.properties

The parameter mode should be set as common.mode=analyze. To run in analyze mode, the model must have been trained
and saved already. The analyze input data directory should be specified as analyze.data.dir=data/topics/analyze
