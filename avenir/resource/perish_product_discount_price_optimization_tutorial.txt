This tutorial is discount price optimization for perishable products using sampson sampling
MAB algorithm. 

Path etc shown here corresposnds to my environment. Please Change them  as needed 
for your environment

Build
=====
Follow instructions in spark_dependency.txt

Create discounts for products
=============================
./samp.sh createDiscounts <num_products>  discount.txt
num_products = number of products

Create inventory and demand distribution model
==============================================
./samp.sh createSampModel <num_products> discount.txt model.txt

Start Spark cluster
===================

First iteration
===============
Set current.decision.round = 1
Copy discount.txt and initial model : cp discount.txt ./input/samp/model.txt
Since there is no reward data available change the parameter name reward.feedback.file.path to xreward.feedback.file.path
Run spark job :   ./samp.sh sampSampling

Further iteration
=================
Set current.decision.round = 3 (e.g)
Copy updated model to input directory : ./samp.sh copyUpdatedModel
Generate reward for current decisions : ./samp.sh sampleReward <num_products> model.txt
Restore parameter reward.feedback.file.path
Run spark job :   ./samp.sh sampSampling

Configuration
=============
It's in samp.conf file
