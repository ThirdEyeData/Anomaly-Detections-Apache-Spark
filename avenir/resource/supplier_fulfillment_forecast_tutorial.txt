This tutorial is supplier fulfillment forecasting in a supply chain. The solution is
based on continuous time markov chain (CTMC). You should make necessary changes to scripts
and config files to suit your environment

Build
=====
chombo
mvn install
sbt publishLocal

chombo/spark
sbt package
sbt publishLocal

avenir/spark
sbt package

Input data
==========
Run
./supplier.py <num_product> <num_weeks> > fulfill.txt

num_product = number of products e.g. 5
num_weeks = number of weeks in past for data generation e.g. 100

Place the data file in the input path specified in sup.sh

Start your cluster
==================
Start HDFS
Start Spark


Create state transition rate matrix
===================================
Run spark job
./sup.sh transRate

Predict time spent in a state
=============================
Create a file with content as below. Pick up the product Ids from the input file created earlier
For the second field choose any of the 3 states in the input file

..............

The configuration parameter state.trans.file.path should point to a directory containing the out 
files from the first job

Run spark job
./sup.sh rateStat

Configuration
=============
It's in sup.conf. Please make necessary changes based on your environment
