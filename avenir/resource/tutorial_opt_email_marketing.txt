This tutorial for optmum email marketing time prediction based on Markov model. 

Dependency
==========
Please refer to dependency.txt

Test data
=========

You can generate customer transaction  data using the script buy_xaction.rb. Make sure that util.rb 
is in the path ../lib. util.rb can be checked out from the project visitante. It's under script 
/ruby/lib directory in that project.

generate training data for transaction (customerID, transactionID, date, amount) as below
./buy_xaction.rb 80000 210 .05  > training.txt
where
customer count = 80000
days count = 210
fraction of customers visting on day = .05

Transaction sequencing MR
=========================
Copy training.txt to HDFS path /Users/pranab/buyhist/sequence/input
hadoop fs -rm /Users/pranab/buyhist/sequence/input/*
hadoop fs -put training.txt  /Users/pranab/buyhist/sequence/input
 
 
Run Projection MR as below to order all transactions for an user by time. Generates
one output line per customer

JAR_NAME=/Users/pranab/Projects/chombo/target/chombo-1.0.jar
CLASS_NAME=org.chombo.mr.Projection
echo "running mr"
IN_PATH=/Users/pranab/buyhist/sequence/input
OUT_PATH=/Users/pranab/buyhist/sequence/output
echo "input $IN_PATH output $OUT_PATH"
hadoop fs -rmr $OUT_PATH
echo "removed output dir"
hadoop jar $JAR_NAME $CLASS_NAME -Dconf.path=/Users/pranab/Projects/bin/avenir/buyhist.properties $IN_PATH $OUT_PATH


Convert transaction sequence to state sequence
==============================================
Run the  following to convert transactions to 2 character state symbols

rm xaction_seq.txt 
hadoop fs -get /Users/pranab/buyhist/sequence/output/part-r-00000 xaction_seq.txt 
./xaction_state.rb xaction_seq.txt > state_seq.txt

Markov Model MR
===============
Copy state_seq.txt to HDFS path /Users/pranab/buyhist/input

hadoop fs -rm /Users/pranab/buyhist/input/*
hadoop fs -put state_seq.txt /Users/pranab/buyhist/input

Run the MR as below
JAR_NAME=/Users/pranab/Projects/avenir/target/avenir-1.0.jar
CLASS_NAME=org.avenir.markov.MarkovStateTransitionModel
echo "running mr"
IN_PATH=/Users/pranab/buyhist/input
OUT_PATH=/Users/pranab/buyhist/output
echo "input $IN_PATH output $OUT_PATH"
hadoop fs -rmr $OUT_PATH
echo "removed output dir"
hadoop jar $JAR_NAME $CLASS_NAME -Dconf.path=/Users/pranab/Projects/bin/avenir/buyhist.properties $IN_PATH $OUT_PATH

Generate validation data
========================
./buy_xaction.rb 80000 30 .05 > validation.txt


Predict email marketing time
============================
Run as below

./mark_plan.rb validation.txt model.txt

The output of Markov model MR should be in model.txt, which is  copied from HDFS path 
/Users/pranab/buyhist/output

Configuration
=============
It's in buyhist.properties
