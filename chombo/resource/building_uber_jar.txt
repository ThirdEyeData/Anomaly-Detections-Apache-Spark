Dependent jars
==============
Hadoop needs all dependent jar at run time. You can always distribute these jars while running 
the map reduce jobs. Another way is to bundle all jar into one uber jar and then use that

chombo depends on the following third party jars. Some of them are needed only when using 
some special features, as indicated by the text in  parenthesis


- always needed
jackson-core-asl-1.9.13.jar
jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.13.jar
commons-lang3-3.1.jar
config-1.2.0.jar

- optional
lucene-core-4.4.0.jar (text analysis)
lucene-analyzers-common-4.4.0.jar (text analysis features, other language analyzers)
groovy-all-2.4.3.jar (for custom scripting in ETM map reduce)

Using ant to build uber jar
===========================
One way to build the uber jar is to use the build file uber_build.xml as follows
ant -f uber_build.xml

If the optional jar files are needed, they should be added to uber_build.xml. The build file
assumes that all the jars to be bundled are available in some directory. If this is not true please
make necessary changes in uber_build.xml
