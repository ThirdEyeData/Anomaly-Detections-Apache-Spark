This tutorial is for analyzing campaign effectiveness. Conversion lag time data is analyzed 
to measure campaign effectiveness. Please modify the script and the configuration files to fit your need

Build
=====
Please refer to building_spark_uber_jar.txt file

Dependent script
================
Checkout the project avenir. Take the script util.py and sampler.py from the project and place it
in ../lib directory with respect the directory containing cust_conversion.py

Generate old conversion data
============================
./cust_conversion.py <num_of_customers> 3 > conv3.txt
num_of_customers = number of customers

Copy the data file to the input directory

Run Spark job
=============
Edit the exp_spark.sh so that it points to the right input file
Comment out reference.distr.file.path in exp.conf

Run
./exp_spark.sh numStat

Copy the output file to the directory as defined by the configuration parameter 
reference.distr.file.path

Generate new conversion data
============================
./cust_conversion.py <num_of_customers> 2 > conv2.txt
num_of_customers = number of customers

Copy the data file to the input directory

Run Spark job
=============
Edit the exp_spark.sh so that it points to the right input file
Uncomment out reference.distr.file.path in exp.conf

Run
./exp_spark.sh numStat

Configuration
=============
The configuration is in exp.conf. Make changes as necessary
