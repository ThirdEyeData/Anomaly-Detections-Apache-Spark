This tutorial is data quality check with outlier. Statistics are caculated for a field.
Outliers are defined in terms z score or . The use case is for supply chain. A wholeseller
receives orders from different retailer stores. 

The statistics are calculated for for  order quantity for each (store, product) pair. 
Statistics are calculated by repeatedly excuting RunningAggregator map reduce with 
fresh batch of store order data. By statistics, we mean average and std deviation.

Dependent script
================
Checkout the project visitante. Take the script util.py and sampler.py from the project and placeit
in ../lib directory with respect the directory containing store_order.py

Deployment
==========
Please refer to building_uber_jar.txt

1. Create products
==================
./store_order.py createProducts <num_of_products> > <product_data_file>

2. Create stores
================
./store_order.py createStores <num_of_stores> > <store_data_file>

3. Create store order
=====================
./vaou.sh genOrder  <product_data_file> <store_data_file> <average_num_products>  <order_data_file>

where 
product_data_file contains the product data, the first field being the product ID
store_data_file contains the store data, the first field being the store ID
average_num_products is the average number of products ordered by a store
order_data_file is the outfile with order data

order_data_file should be named such that it starts with string defined by the config
parameter rug.incremental.file.prefix

For product_data_file and store_data_file it's only the first field that matters.

4. Export order data to HDFS
============================
./vaou.sh loadIncr   <order_data_file>

5. Generate running statistics
==============================
./vaou.sh runningAggr

6. Replace old Stas with new
============================
./vaou.sh replaceAggr

7. Final stats
==============
Steps 3,4,5,6 should be repeated as many times as necessary to  to generate
reliable stats for order quantity.

8. Check quality with outliers
==============================
./vaou.sh  valOutlier

Configuration
=============
Sample configuration is in vaou.properties file
