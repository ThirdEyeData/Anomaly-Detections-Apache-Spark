This tutorial is identifying products with seasonal demand. This result could be used
to augment recommendation results with products with seasonal demand.

You should should change the script and configuration property files according to 
your need and environment.

Dependent script
================
Checkout the project avenir. Take the script util.py and sampler.py from the project and 
placeit in ../lib directory with respect the directory containing seasonal_xaction.py

Generate input
==============
./sdem.sh <num_products> <num_xactions> <output_file>

where
num_products = number of products e.g. 100
num_xactions = number of transactions e.g. 5000
output_file = output file name

Load input to HDFS
==================
./sdem.sh loadInp <file_generated-in_previous step>

Run MR for seasonal cycle detection
===================================
./sdem.sh seasonalityDetector

Run MR for histogram and other statistics
=========================================
./sdem.sh numDistStat

Run MR to detect cycles corresponding to modes in distribution
==============================================================
./sdem.sh seasonalCycleFinder

Configuration
=============
Configurations are defined in sdem.properties for all the map reduce jobs.
Please feel free to change based on your needs
