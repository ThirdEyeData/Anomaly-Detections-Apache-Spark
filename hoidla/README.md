## Introduction
Set of reusable big data real time streaming algorithms. Can be used by  Spark Streaming, Storm 
or any other stream computation framework

## Philosophy
* Plain java API that can be used from any stream computation framework

## Blogs
The following blogs of mine are good source of details. These are the only source
of detail documentation

## Solution
* Probabilstic frequent count with sketches and count based algorithms
* Probabilstic cardinality or unique item count
* Probabilstic set inclusion 
* Different sampling methods
* Windowing including simple stats
* Pattern detection
* Event cluster detection

## Getting started
Project's resource directory has various tutorial documents for the use cases described in the blogs.
